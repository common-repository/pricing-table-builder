#### Why should I use?

A pricing table must be simple but at the same time clearly differentiate between features and prices of different products or services. A pricing table should help potential customers pick the most appropriate plan for them.

Plugin clearly gives visitors only the information they would be interested in: available features, options and costs. If a pricing table is not nicely constructed/designed it increases the probability of losing potential customers, because you make it more difficult for them to compare various plans and select the best one.

Our plugin gives you the possibility of adding from 2 to 6 pricing plans. We also have a wide range of themes, which gives you a rich and diverse choice of what will suit your website better. You can also add unlimited number of features to your different plans writing each feature in a separate line. The preview button allows you to see how the price table you created will look on your web page.
Our pricing table builder is perfect to showcase the main features of your product/service and expose them in different packages, marking one of them as the 'recommended' or 'the best' bundle. Embedded pare responsive and coded to automatically fit into your layout. You don't need to worry about the width values, it will take the available space you give them. Pricing table builder contains many customization options and predefined styles, which means, your will meet the needs your theme/design requires.

== Other Notes ==

If you have products or services selling on your website, you'll be needing Pricing Tables. You can demonstrate the prices of your products and services in a nice and organized way. Pricing tables will not only help you organize the price demonstration on your page, but also make it more attractive and professional. You should include the features of your products/services, their prices, the time of the payment (per-year, per-month, per-week, etc.), also you can choose the best plan of your pricing table and highlight it. 

= Structure =

Pricing tables are usually horizontal. That's just because it's more organized and more convenient to compare the features and prices when they're presented next to each other. But you can make it vertical, if you wish, it's up to your preferences! If the plans, the features and the whole content are not so extended, that may even look quite good. 

= Design =

Design is a powerful tool in every sphere and every structure. Web design is not an exception. The look and feel of your pricing tables may be very important in your sales. Well-organized and in general, is pleasant to look at, the customers will surely pay attention to it. Every single detail should be neatly done and has to be balanced. Design can increase your sales and you should remember that simplicity is the key to success of price chart. You should concentrate on the most important things and do not include not necessary things to your tables. You can't add any imaginary features to your columns that you don't really have. Everything must be clear and must be done honestly, without any tricks. As the experience shows, this may give you some advantages and up sales at the beginning but roughly affect your sales after the truth comes out. So, be very attentive, and create a pricing table based on real features and real prices.
